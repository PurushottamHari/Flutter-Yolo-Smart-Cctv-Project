# Flutter-Yolo-Smart-Cctv-Project
The app utilizes the Yolo implementation to detect objects which can indicate threats in areas such as guns and knives.
On successful detection, the script launches a call to firestore database which is in constant connection with the Androi/IOS app(Used by the concerned authority).
The App has instant SOS features and an option to label the responses with "Fake Alert" or "Real Alert" to better the model for further training.
